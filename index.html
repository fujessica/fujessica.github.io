        Disclaimer: None of these people are real and these personality critiques shouldn't be taken serioudly.

            <h3>Alanah Hill</h3>
                <p title="clickformore">
                    Alanah is a thoughtful person but struggles with having a backbone at times. I don't understand why she's still with her crusty ex and there are just some 
                    things we will never see eye to eye on becuase of that...
                </p>

            <h3>Jenora Cottle</h3>
                <p>
                    She certainly is a character. She sometimes talks more than she needs to and is a bit too comfortable too fast. Often embarasses herself and the people around her because of her loud and abrasive personality. She doesn't hate easily and is usually has good intentions.
