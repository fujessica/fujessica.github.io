                <p>We are very happy</p>
                <p>Burnside highschool is one of the happiest places on earth and if you ask any of the students there, they will agree. They're drugged up on the vapes, hypothetically. Burnside highschool has good facilities such as a blue hockey turf and a pool! We also have 3 huge fields that the children in Burnside can live in, run in and eat from. </p>

                <p>Burnside Highschool has a large variety of clubs to join. With a diverse amount of communities, students can find friends throughout the school easily by attending clubs they're interested in. At Burnside we have esports club, debate club, drama club and way more. Esports club is kind of dying though so I would join if I were a teenager at Burnside.</p>
